## Ingredients

* Tomato passiert (good brand) 5 packs
* 2x 400g mince beef
* 100g bacon (200g produces a lot of fat, too much for my liking)
* Worcester sauce
* Oregano dry and thinly sliced
* Salt, pepper, sugar
* One small onion finely sliced
* One garlic clove crushed or sliced
* cooking oil (high temp resistant olive oil)

## Preparation

1. add some Worcester sauce over the mince and let marinate for a bit

## Cooking

2. 1/3 of onion in a pot with olive oil, when ready, add garlic and then ALL the tomato
3. sprinkle with generous amounts of oregano
3. 1/3 of the onion + garlic for each 400-500g beef
4. once each round of meat is ready, just add to sauce
5. if you leave the pot open, the water from the meat will evaporate too, but we don't want it too intense
7. let sauce cook for an hour and keep on tasting
8. add salt, some sugar
9. once done, it's enough for 3 generous batches for 4 people
